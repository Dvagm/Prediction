# Prediction

This repository contains a Prediction Category project aimed at building predictive models using various Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The project covers the entire process from data collection and exploration to model evaluation.

ðŸš€ Key Features:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Applying data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
Modeling: Implementing models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Visualization: Providing insightful visualizations to better understand patterns and relationships in the data.
